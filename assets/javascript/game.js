// randomly generated number
// each crystal (4) represents a number that is hidden (has a value)
// each time you click it, it adds to your total score
// the only way to see the value of the crystal is by clicking it
// match your score to the random number
// when the match happens, you get a win point
// when you lose you get a minus point
// the game restarts and the target number and the crystal value numbers change
// random number to match is between 19 and 120
// crystal numbers are between 1 and 12


// create variables
var crystal1 = ?;
var crystal2 = ?;
var crystal3 = ?;
var crystal4 = ?;
var targetNumber = ?;
var userNumber = ?;
var wins = 0;
var losses = 0;

// generate random number for targetNumber between 19 and 120

// generate random number for crystal1 between 1 and 12
// generate random number for crystal2 between 1 and 12
// generate random number for crystal3 between 1 and 12
// generate random number for crystal4 between 1 and 12
// attach those values to the variables between 1 and 12
